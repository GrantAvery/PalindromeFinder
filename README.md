  PalindromeFinder
</h1>

### Simple C# console app to inform the user whether some text input is a palindrome

Another in a series of simple programs to keep my coding skills fresh. Built using .NET Core 2.2.

//TODO: make tests

## Build:

Navigate to {baseRepo}/PalindromeFinder in the console app of your choice

```
$ csc Program.cs
```

## Run:
### On PC

```
$ Program
```

### On Mac

You'll need [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) installed but otherwise it isn't much more complicated.

```
$ mono Program.exe
```
